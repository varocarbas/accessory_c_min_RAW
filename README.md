# accessory_c_min

Library containing a set of miscellaneous resources accessorily used by most of my C code. 

**WARNING: this repository is being regularly updated with all the latest modifications. And I am currently working on the most basic parts and coming up with the main structure and conventions. The likelihood of finding important errors in some parts is high.**

# \_RAW repositories
All the \_RAW repositories include code which I use for personal purposes. The overall structure and used conventions are assumed to be more than enough for an experienced programmer to adequately understand and appreciate everything. 

# authorship & copyright
I, Alvaro Carballo Garcia (varocarbas), am the sole author of each single bit of this code.

Equivalently to what happens with all my other online contributions, this code can be considered public domain. For more information about my copyright/authorship attribution ideas, visit [https://customsolvers.com/copyright/](https://customsolvers.com/copyright/).
